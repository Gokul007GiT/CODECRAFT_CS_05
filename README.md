INTERNSHIP:  Codecraft Infotech – Cybersecurity_05

This tool captures and analyzes network packets using Scapy. It displays the
timestamp, source IP, destination IP, protocol type (TCP/UDP/ICMP/OTHER),
packet length, and a small payload preview when available. The tool is
intended strictly for educational use.
This packet sniffer is designed only for learning and testing on authorized
networks. Unauthorized interception of network traffic may be illegal and
unethical.
